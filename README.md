# About
This is a demo project for learning how to build AI agents with langchain and langGraph.

## Setup
First install poetry: pipx install poetry
Then run:
- `poetry install` to install dependencies
- `poetry env info --path` for the virtural environment path

If using vscode: ctrl + shift + p and type python: select interpreter, choose "Enter interpreter path" and paste the venv path. Make sure the interpreter path is the path to the virtual environment you just created in poetry. 
It should be something like: Poetry (langgraphbot-uAaZHXKr-py3.12)
