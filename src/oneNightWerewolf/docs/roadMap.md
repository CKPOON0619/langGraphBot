# One Night Werewolf Development Roadmap

## 1. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Design and Prototyping
- **Task:** Create detailed interface definitions for all components.
- **Outcome:** Clear contracts for communication between Host, PlayerInterface, and PlayerAgent.

### Phase 2: Core Development
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement the Host class with game initialization, phase management, and state management.
  - Develop the PlayerInterface to handle communication and state management.
  - Create the PlayerAgent class for decision-making logic.
  - Implement the BaseRole class and specific role classes.

### Phase 3: Error Handling and Security
- **Tasks:**
  - Develop a comprehensive error handling framework.
  - Implement security measures for information access and action validation.

### Phase 4: User Interface Development
- **Tasks:**
  - Design and implement the user interface for HumanPlayer interactions.
  - Ensure accessibility features are included.

### Phase 5: LLM Integration
- **Tasks:**
  - Integrate LLM for AI player decision-making.
  - Define how the LLM will be trained and tested for game context.

### Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Tasks:**
  - Develop unit tests for individual components.
  - Create integration tests to ensure components work together.
  - Conduct end-to-end tests to simulate full game scenarios.
  - Perform user testing to gather feedback on the interface and gameplay.

## 2. Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual methods in Host, PlayerInterface, PlayerAgent, and BaseRole classes.
- Ensure that each role's actions and validations are thoroughly tested.

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between Host and PlayerInterface, ensuring that game state updates are correctly communicated.
- Validate the interaction between PlayerInterface and PlayerAgent.

### End-to-End Testing
- Simulate full game scenarios to ensure that all components work together seamlessly.
- Test various player interactions, including voting, discussions, and night actions.

### User Testing
- Conduct sessions with real players to gather feedback on the user interface and overall experience.
- Iterate on the design based on user feedback to improve usability.

## 3. Documentation and Communication

### Documentation
- Maintain comprehensive documentation for all components, including class responsibilities, method descriptions, and usage examples.
- Document the error handling strategy and testing procedures.

### Communication
- Establish regular stand-up meetings to keep the team aligned and address blockers.
- Use collaborative tools (e.g., project management software) to track progress and facilitate communication.

## 4. Security Considerations

### Information Access Control
- Implement strict access controls to ensure that players can only access information relevant to their roles.

### Action Validation
- Ensure that all actions are validated against game rules to prevent cheating or unintended behavior.

### State Integrity
- Implement mechanisms to ensure that the game state remains consistent and secure throughout gameplay.
