# Player Architecture Requirements

## Overview
The Player system is split into two distinct layers:
1. PlayerInterface - Game mechanics and Host communication
2. PlayerAgent - Decision making implementation (Human/LLM)

## PlayerInterface Requirements

### 1. Host Communication
- Receive and process game state updates
- Submit valid actions to Host
- Handle Host requests for actions
- Process game phase transitions
- Receive and manage role assignments

### 2. Game State Management
- Store current role
- Store original role
- Track role changes
- Maintain action history
- Record known information
- Track game phase

### 3. Action Management
- Validate action timing
- Verify action legality
- Format actions for Host
- Record action results
- Handle failed actions

### 4. Information Control
- Filter information based on role rules
- Track legitimate knowledge
- Maintain information history
- Control information access
- Format information for PlayerAgent

### 5. Validation
- Ensure actions follow game rules
- Validate timing of responses
- Verify information access rights
- Check action eligibility

## PlayerAgent Requirements

### 1. Decision Interface
Must implement decisions for:
- Night actions
- Discussion contributions
- Voting
- Response to questions
- Information sharing

### 2. Information Processing
Must be able to:
- Receive game state
- Process available actions
- Understand current context
- Track conversation history
- Process other players' actions

### 3. Response Format
Must provide:
- Clear action choices
- Formatted discussion inputs
- Valid vote selections
- Properly structured responses

## HumanPlayer Requirements
### 1. User Interface
- Clear action prompts
- Information display
- Input validation
- Error messages
- Action confirmation

### 2. Information Display
- Current role information
- Available actions
- Game state updates
- Other players' actions
- Discussion history

### 3. Input Handling
- Command parsing
- Input validation
- Error correction
- Action confirmation
- Cancel options

## LLMPlayer Requirements
### 1. Strategic Processing
- Game state analysis
- Strategy formation
- Role-appropriate behavior
- Information evaluation
- Decision making

### 2. Communication
- Natural language generation
- Context-aware responses
- Role-appropriate deception
- Consistent character
- Strategic information sharing

### 3. Memory Management
- Track conversation history
- Remember previous actions
- Maintain consistent strategy
- Update beliefs based on new information

## Interaction Requirements

### 1. Host <-> PlayerInterface
- Standardized communication protocol
- Clear action formats
- Validated responses
- Error handling
- State synchronization

### 2. PlayerInterface <-> PlayerAgent
- Abstracted game state
- Formatted action choices
- Standardized response format
- Error handling
- Timeout management

## Technical Considerations
1. All game logic must reside in PlayerInterface
2. PlayerAgent should only handle decisions
3. Clear separation of concerns
4. Standardized communication protocols
5. Proper error handling at both layers
6. Consistent state management
7. Clear validation rules

## Security Considerations
1. Information access control
2. Action validation
3. State integrity
4. Response verification
5. Timing control
